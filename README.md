# StoryBook Weddings
JDS Consultants created a future social media application that currently allows users to browse through posted weddings and view individual weddings to find inspiration. We also want users to post their own own wedding experience so that they and others can not only find inspiration, but share their beautiful day.

# User Story
As developers we created a real-world full-stack application that incorporated Handlebars, CSS, Node.js and Express.js to create a RESTful API. We utilized MySQL and the Sequelize ORM for the database. This application at minimum allow the user to:

* View galleries and couples wedding essentials
* Post their own wedding essentials:
  **Couple Profile Name** 
  **Wedding Date**
  * **Theme** 
  * **Band**
  * **Main Dish**
  * **Description**

## Installation

GIVEN a wedding social media application
WHEN I open the Home Page
THEN I am presented with a link to a login/register
Then I enter my email, username, and password on the form 
THEN I am presented with a page with empty fields to enter my own information to create/post my profile  
THEN the profile I have entered is saved and appears in the gallery page
WHEN I click on an existing couples page, I am taken to that couple's wedding information.
WHEN I click on the View Gallery icon in the navigation at the top of the page
THEN I am presented with a gallery of couples. 
When I click on the Contact icon, I am then presented with a link to send an email to the consultants. 
When I click on the home button, I am brought back to the home page. 


This application authenticates with B-Script and the new technology that is used is express

In this project, we learned a lot -- more specifically -- about APIs, the Handlebars models, JavaScript and GitHub, as well and selecting specific data points from the APIs to "inject" them into the Handlebars for a dynamic user experience.
